"We heard so many good things about this place and was excited to try it. We made reservations on our first day in Rome (12/1/2021). We ordered the carbonara, cacio e pepe, roman-artichoke and fresh mozzarella. Both pasta dishes were EXTREMELY salty. I love salt just as much as the next guy, but these were next level salty!! 🤢Needless to say I wouldn't recommend this place, so many other good place to eat and you don't need to make reservations!","{'food': ['extremely salty'], 'service': [], 'ambiance': []}",food is extremely salty.

A must for the Roman classics and experience. There’s a reason everyone wants a table here. Great wine list as well.,"{'food': ['great'], 'service': [], 'ambiance': []}",food is great.
"We went there twice and I had carbonara on both visits. The first time the food was really exceptional and deserved 4 stars, the second visit it was really mediocre and not worthy of more than one star. The amount of salt in everything was crazy!

I told this to a friend of mine who is a regular there and he'd been back a couple of days before us and also found the quality was totally unreliable.

Service pleasant and efficient. Great wine list.

Hopefully things will straighten out again in the future but for now I'd say skip it. There are lots of excellent restaurants in Rome.","{'food': ['really exceptional', 'great'], 'service': ['pleasant'], 'ambiance': []}","food is great, really exceptional. service is pleasant."
"Armando is our must visit restaurant in Rome, family run, great location and (in my opinion) the best Carbonara in Rome.

We always have pasta as a starter and then a different pasta for main course. Portions are not small so go hungry and go easy on the bread 😂

You can book online and I suggest you book ahead since they are almost always full. Whilst this is lovely for dinner, we tend to go for lunch since we then have the rest of the day to walk off the carbs.","{'food': ['lovely', 'not small'], 'service': [], 'ambiance': []}","food is not small, lovely."

"Reservation highly recommended. One of the best amatriciana, cacio e pepe and carbonara in Roma. Prices are fair  and staffs are super friendly.  They have a great natural wine list.
Currently, they have outdoor seating  with Pantheon view.
I had a couple of dinners and lunches during my prolonged stay.  The fried fish was alright, but their veal and pastas were to die for.","{'food': ['natural', 'great'], 'service': [], 'ambiance': ['outdoor']}","food is natural, great. ambiance is outdoor."

"A three generation restaurant since 1961 next to the pantheon.
The Bruschetta featured some of the tastiest tomatoes I’ve ever had. They were so juicy, strong in flavor, yet with the perfect balance of slightly sweet and tangy. The Buffalo mozzarella was decent, fresh and creamy but a little too chewy like rubber.
The Spaghetti allá carbonara was very fresh and made perfectly al dente. The sauce is eggy, creamy, and salty, so thick that it began to clump and stick together after a bit. The cured pork cheek adds smokiness, but went perhaps over the top on salt.
Lastly the torta antica Roma was a crumble tart that shares the same flavor attributes of a refined peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Instead of peanut, sesame and poppy seeds are used to produce a subtler taste. This is paired with a light layer of ricotta and a strawberry jam.","{'food': ['a subtler', 'same', 'strong'], 'service': [], 'ambiance': []}","food is same, a subtler, strong."

"If the view on the Pantheon is not enough, the food, wine and service are also great.
I tried spaghetti carbonara - the only comment here is that guanciale bits were on the softer and less crispy side (but that's up to the personal preference).
I was served a glass of great wine that went perfectly with the pasta.
And the bread (not complimentary but it will be served to you even if you don't order it) was just amazing","{'food': ['also great', 'great'], 'service': [], 'ambiance': []}","food is great, also great."

"Excellent food! One of the best meals I had during my trip to Rome. Enjoyed the anchovies starter which was a special for the day. The black truffle spaghetti was divine - simple and tossed in olive oil, bringing out the beautiful aroma and flavour from the black truffles. The wine pairing that was recommended perfectly complemented the food. Tiramisu was great as well. Highly recommended and would definitely visit again!","{'food': ['excellent', 'the best'], 'service': [], 'ambiance': []}","food is the best, excellent."
"Armando is a nice, cozy restaurant near the pantheon (going out of the restaurant after dinner and facing the monument is definitely a plus). I am usually suspicious of the quality of the restaurants downtown, so I was a bit hesitant about going there. But, I am glad we did; our meal was fantastic and it lives up to the expectations. My friend and I had pasta a la griccia, carbonara, and the smoked lamb. Everything was delicious, and service was efficient.

There are only 15 tables in the restaurant. Therefore, making a reservation is a must (and one can do it online). It is important to note that prices are definitely on the expensive side of the spectrum (which was expected given the restaurant’s location).","{'food': ['fantastic'], 'service': ['efficient'], 'ambiance': []}",food is fantastic. service is efficient.

"I can add myself to the long list of excellent reviews of this restaurant. Everything on the menu is excellent although for me the artichoke romana was so good I could make a meal of it. If people don’t like this place then the problem is them. Reserve, show up on time and prepare to enjoy.

I would like to add an additional comment.  There were many reviews remarking about rude treatment directed specifically against Asians which I did not witness.  What we did see when we were there for dinner was a Japanese woman with her husband being greeted, hugged actually, by the chef who had come from the kitchen to embrace them and welcome them warmly for dinner.  For the record I did not see him come out for anyone else the rest of the evening.  I do know this is a popular place, reservations are required and showing up on time is important and considerate.  Just because a table looks empty doesn't mean it has not been reserved.","{'food': [], 'service': [], 'ambiance': []}",

"I can't understand all the high reviews this restaurant gets.  We travel and eat out a lot, speak Italian, and while in Rome went to many restaurants, all fabulous but this one.  It is a tiny restaurant and was featured on Stanley Tucchi's series about eating in Italy so it gets many tourists.  They gave you every impression that you weren't wanted.  We were there in July and requested a table outside, but they seated us, and all other tourists,  inside while all the locals, which arrived after us, were seated outside to enjoy the gorgeous evening and view of the Pantheon.  The atmosphere inside felt like a morgue, including a bad odor which we smelled the minute we walked in.  Service was incredibly slow as all the waiters were focused on serving the tables of locals outside.  We ordered an antipasti and a pasta each and they never brought the antipasti.  Our pasta was fine, but no better than any of the other restaurants we ate at in Italy.  Really do yourself and them a favor, and eat somewhere else.","{'food': [], 'service': ['incredibly slow'], 'ambiance': []}",service is incredibly slow.
"I wish I knew of Armando Al Pantheon when I was a student studying a few blocks away -- not that I would have been able to go, but it would have been a perfect ""parents"" meal. Intimate, historic, traditional. Incredibly tasty. And some great art on the walls to just top it off. (We happened to eat beneath a Renzo Piano sketch.)

Don't be distracted by the proximity to its namesake -- there is nothing ""tourist trap"" about this restaurant. If only we had more meals to eat on our recent trip . . .","{'food': ['a perfect', 'more'], 'service': [], 'ambiance': []}","food is more, a perfect."

"Since 1961 Armando Al Pantheon has been serving traditional Roman fare in the shadow of a timeless landmark, and although tourists have started to catch on, the tiny wood-paneled room is still largely populated by locals who desire a taste of Chef Claudio Gargioli’s hearty and historic Food.

Family owned for nearly sixty years, sons Claudio and Fabrizio as well as and granddaughter Fabiana now operating front and back of house, it is immediately upon entry that guests will note just fourteen tables, servers regularly turning away potential patrons who have unfortunately failed to make the requisite reservation.

Rooted in history, and closed Saturday after lunch service through to Monday, it is once seated that guests are offered Bread and Beverage, plus a menu full of dishes that date-back centuries and a few daily specials.

Still finding Chef Claudio involved, on this day touching tables and signing copies of his cookbook, it was after some debate that lunch was ordered in four courses, a starter of “Anchovy Cake” finding briny bits countered by Pine Nuts and Tomatoes while textural diversity was dialed up by Bread Crumbs and Cracklings.

Following Roman tradition in offering plenty of Offal, housemade Fettuccine achieving excellence despite using anything but the parts typically considered “desirable,” Armando Al Pantheon’s Tripe is tender and flawless, Mint coming in mid-palate and quickly dissipating while Black Pepper and Tomato linger at the finish.

Well known for “Torta Antica Roma,” a dish reportedly invented by Claudio Gargioli that clearly takes notes from Pasticceria Boccione and others, guests can expect to see a slice on every table to finish, and after the first bite of crumbled Topping, soft Cheese and Jam it is easy to understand why.","{'food': ['historic', 'hearty', 'full', 'a full'], 'service': [], 'ambiance': []}","food is full, a full, historic, hearty."
"All you can do sometimes is relate your experience.... and this one was a little strange....
We made an reservation and we arrived on time.  We ordered two simple pasta dishes.  45 minutes later they came to apologize - they said the cook was ""having trouble with the pasta"" something about not making enough hot water?  Ok, that's weird.  At least we had a bottle of wine to drink while we watched them serve plate after plate of pasta to other guests, some of whom arrived after we did.
When our meals arrived, it was immediately clear that the pasta was not cooked; it was almost crunchy in the middle.  BOTH of our dishes were this way!  It was not edible, so we pushed our plates away and waited for the waiter to come.   He explained our pasta was simply, ""al dente"" and that we were wrong - did he just get snippy with us?    After months worth of traveling in Italy, and our second month in Rome specifically, we have eaten a ton of pasta and know what ""al dente""  is!  Ridiculous!   They were having trouble in the kitchen and we paid the price I guess.  We left without having eaten.  With so many good places to eat in Rome, we will never go back.  Not a good experience.","{'food': ['two simple'], 'service': [], 'ambiance': []}",food is two simple.

"Great food, one of the old school restaurants in Rome.

I can’t say enough about Armando al Pantheon!! My husband and I snagged a last minute 10pm reservation online the day of (check their website or call ahead - don’t just show up). Everything we ate was delectable and the pasta was so fresh which was exactly what we were looking for. The restaurant’s sommelier comes to your table with their extensive wine list and recommends what will go best with your meal. We chose a white blend that paired extremely well. Don’t miss dessert.. the brioche with whipped cream and the chocolate mousse were to die for.

"Prior to going to Rome, I googled restaurants and Armando al Pantheon came up as a ""must go"" suggestion. And I have to say the review and suggestion was spot on. The restaurant is located within the same area/square as the Pantheon and it is a nice quiet location. The server was very polite and patient with us two Americans trying to decide what we wanted. The atmosphere was great and the food was AMAZING. I had the Veal and potatoes, and it did not disappoint (sidenote: it was a great portion size as well).

"We had an amazing meal at Armando on our first night in Rome. It's true, it is heavily trafficked by foreigners and tourists during dinner time, but they have not let the quality of the food slip. The pasta's were killer, including the Gricia, Aglio e Oili (which was quite spicy!) and the pasta with chicken livers. The veal was also very good, and the tripe was excellent.

"Distinctly average all round. No atmosphere inside and mostly tourists. Food is edible - but truly one of the worst meals I’ve eaten in Rome. If you’re looking for authentic Roman classics, you’re better off at several other restaurants. Meat is tough and leathery, vegetables taste canned or overboiled, bread is stale. What would have made up for it - atmosphere, decor etc - is non existent. Definitely a tourist trap. For the people saying it’s the best amatriciana in Rome- dear god.

Authentic Roman cuisine. Many common Italian dishes but if you are an adventurous eater you can also find something very different here. They are serious about the quality of their dishes.  Small charming restaurant that is always full. You must have a reservation or will be cordially turned away. We got lucky and had the presence of Steve Martin and his party in the restaurant. It was nice to see they were left alone to enjoy their meal while at the same time the staff treated everyone in the restaurant like a celebrity.,"{'food': ['many common italian', 'authentic roman'], 'service': [], 'ambiance': []}","food is authentic roman, many common italian."
