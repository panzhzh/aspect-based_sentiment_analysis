The Bruschetta featured some of the tastiest tomatoes I’ve ever had. They were so juicy, strong in flavor, yet with the perfect balance of slightly sweet and tangy. The Buffalo mozzarella was decent, fresh and creamy but a little too chewy like rubber.
The Spaghetti allá carbonara was very fresh and made perfectly al dente. The sauce is eggy, creamy, and salty, so thick that it began to clump and stick together after a bit. The cured pork cheek adds smokiness, but went perhaps over the top on salt.
Lastly the torta antica Roma was a crumble tart that shares the same flavor attributes of a refined peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Instead of peanut, sesame and poppy seeds are used to produce a subtler taste.

I would like to add an additional comment.  There were many reviews remarking about rude treatment directed specifically against Asians which I did not witness.  What we did see when we were there for dinner was a Japanese woman with her husband being greeted, hugged actually, by the chef who had come from the kitchen to embrace them and welcome them warmly for dinner.  For the record I did not see him come out for anyone else the rest of the evening.  I do know this is a popular place, reservations are required and showing up on time is important and considerate.

Family owned for nearly sixty years, sons Claudio and Fabrizio as well as and granddaughter Fabiana now operating front and back of house, it is immediately upon entry that guests will note just fourteen tables, servers regularly turning away potential patrons who have unfortunately failed to make the requisite reservation.

Rooted in history, and closed Saturday after lunch service through to Monday, it is once seated that guests are offered Bread and Beverage, plus a menu full of dishes that date-back centuries and a few daily specials.

Still finding Chef Claudio involved, on this day touching tables and signing copies of his cookbook, it was after some debate that lunch was ordered in four courses, a starter of “Anchovy Cake” finding briny bits countered by Pine Nuts and Tomatoes while textural diversity was dialed up by Bread Crumbs and Cracklings.

Following Roman tradition in offering plenty of Offal, housemade Fettuccine achieving excellence despite using anything but the parts typically considered “desirable,” Armando Al Pantheon’s Tripe is tender and flawless, Mint coming in mid-palate and quickly dissipating while Black Pepper and Tomato linger at the finish.

Well known for “Torta Antica Roma,” a dish reportedly invented by Claudio Gargioli that clearly takes notes from Pasticceria Boccione and others, guests can expect to see a slice on every table to finish, and after the first bite of crumbled Topping, soft Cheese and Jam it is easy to understand why.",https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMipEWsinRmRcxh4lKIQ3llu8g4ixkIdMsWjQ89,,,,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m5!14m4!1m3!1m2!1s102310126330311462271!2s0x0:0x91fde7e0e4de70fe?hl=en-US,4,1582805767,02/27/2020 12:16:07,1,-7926924816003731202

We made an reservation and we arrived on time.  We ordered two simple pasta dishes.  45 minutes later they came to apologize - they said the cook was ""having trouble with the pasta"" something about not making enough hot water?  Ok, that's weird.  At least we had a bottle of wine to drink while we watched them serve plate after plate of pasta to other guests, some of whom arrived after we did.
When our meals arrived, it was immediately clear that the pasta was not cooked; it was almost crunchy in the middle.  BOTH of our dishes were this way!  It was not edible, so we pushed our plates away and waited for the waiter to come.   He explained our pasta was simply, ""al dente"" and that we were wrong - did he just get snippy with us?    After months worth of traveling in Italy, and our second month in Rome specifically, we have eaten a ton of pasta and know what ""al dente""  is!  Ridiculous!   They were having trouble in the kitchen and we paid the price I guess.  We left without having eaten.  With so many good places to eat in Rome, we will never go back.
